The website isn't there anymore, but this code used to power quicksaysomethingnice.com,
and its evil twin quicksaysomethingmean.com.

[Nice like this](https://web.archive.org/web/20140831155637/http://quicksaysomethingnice.com/),
[Mean like this](https://web.archive.org/web/20141218041145/http://quicksaysomethingmean.com/).

Basically it was just a database of one-liners that the internet submitted, that were
either encouraging or rude. The submissions had varying degrees of quality.

[But at its best, I loved it.](https://twitter.com/icculus/status/768732870026391552)

This code could be useful for similar endeavors...a website that just pops out a single
fortune cookie worth of wisdom on each reload, I don't know.
